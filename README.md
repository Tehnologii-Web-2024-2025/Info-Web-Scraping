# Info-Web-Scraping

Here you will find a summary of Web Scraping seminar and it's documentation. For more questions related to this subject, please contact Mihai on MS Teams or WhatsApp. 

## Why Web Scraping

The internet is full of information, but how can you access it? Let's say you want a small app that can monitor the weather for you based on other websites or apps for an increased accuracy, but the API's offered by some weather apps may cost a plenty. Here Web Scraping comes to your help! You can simply build a bot using python that can run by itself at some certain and collect the data from those websites and do the analasys for you. 

<h3>!!! BUT PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND ALWAYS CHECK IF THE WEBSITE ALLOWS YOU TO DO SO !!!</h3>

## How Do I Check If a Website Allows Me to Scrape It?

It's quite simple, every website is required to have a file called <i><b>robots.txt</b></i>. This file should contain the paths that the owners don't want you to access via a web crawling or web scraping bot. <a href="https://www.digi24.ro/robots.txt">Check this Robots.txt file as an example.</a>

You will find more info about accessing webistes via bots at the seminar.


## What Should I Do If I Miss a Seminar? 

<b>Don't worry!</b> Each seminar will have a special Pull Request (PR for short from now on) with the updates on everything learned and a special branch called "Seminar \#Num". Also, if you want only to play with the code, just pull the branch and <b>have fun with it!</b>

## Where Can I Find More Info About Web Scraping

The internet is full of forums with enough info to get you started on this path, I will link some resources at the end, but a small advice from Mihai is the following: always ask yourself "Where is all the info coming from and how can become the browser?".\
